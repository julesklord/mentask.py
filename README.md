**askgem** is a professional, autonomous coding agent that lives in your terminal.
Powered by Google Gemini, it reads your files, edits your code, runs shell commands,
and navigates your filesystem — all within an interactive session and with
hardened safety guardrails that keep you in control.

No GUI. No cloud sync. No bloat. Just a fast, opinionated CLI agent you can trust
with your codebase.

## How it works

askgem runs an advanced asynchronous reasoning loop powered by the **AgentOrchestrator** and a modular manager-based core. On each turn:

1. **Environmental Awareness**: At startup, the **ContextManager** performs a **Project Blueprint** scan, discovering the project type, structure, and key files to build a proactive system instruction.
2. **Cognitive Loop**: Your message is processed by the **AgentOrchestrator**, which manages the *Thinking -> Action -> Observation* cycle.
3. **Tool Reasoning**: The model calls specialized tools (read, edit, execute). askgem intercepts these via the **ToolDispatcher**.
4. **Safety Guard**: Every action passes through the **Security Layer** for real-time risk analysis and path validation.
5. **Stream Processing**: The **StreamProcessor** extracts function calls and text mid-flight, showing you the agent's "thought process" in real-time.
6. **Persistence**: The full session, including tool results and metrics, is auto-saved to your Workspace history.

This autonomous loop repeats until the mission is accomplished or you interrupt it.

## Features

### Agentic tool engine

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_directory` | Explore filesystem trees with depth control |
| `read_file` | Read any file with optional line ranges — 30k char cap prevents token overflow |
| `edit_file` | Find-and-replace with **atomic writing**, uniqueness guard, and automatic `.bkp` backup |
| `execute_bash` | Run shell commands with 60s timeout and full **Risk Analysis** |
| `manage_memory` | Save important project facts to `memory.md` for long-term recall |
| `manage_mission` | Track complex goals and sub-tasks via `heartbeat.md` mission control |
| `manage_workspace` | **[v0.11.0]** Detects and initializes local project knowledge bases |

### Workspace Isolation & Local Intelligence

AskGem now distinguishes between your **Global Persona** and your **Project Context**:
- **Local Priority**: If a `.askgem/` folder exists in your project, it takes precedence for settings, memory, and history.
- **Project Memory**: Knowledge saved via `manage_memory` is stored within the project, preventing context leakage between repositories.
- **Mission Persistence**: Track specific dev-missions per project without cluttering your global space.

### Human-in-the-loop safety

Every destructive action is categorized by risk level (`SAFE`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `DANGEROUS`).
Switch modes anytime mid-session:

- **`/mode manual`** (default) — approve each file edit and shell command.
- **`/mode auto`** — trust the agent fully; all actions execute without prompts.

### Modern TUI Dashboard (Push-Layout)

A stable, high-performance interface built with the `Textual` framework, optimized for Windows:
- Real-time syntax-highlighted Markdown streaming.
- Reactive Sidebar showing live model context, current mission, and token stats.
- Command Palette with autocomplete suggestions for slash commands.
- Hidden output pane (F12) for detailed tool execution logs and debug info.

### Persistent session history

Every conversation auto-saves to `~/.askgem/history/` as JSON. Reload any past
session with `/history load <id>`. A rolling context window and proactive summarization
keep reloaded sessions within token budget.

## New in v0.11.0: Hyper-Context & Security Hardening

The v0.11.0 release evolves AskGem from a reactive assistant into a proactive agent with hardened security:

### 1. AgentOrchestrator
The core logic has been centralized into an Orchestrator that manages the cognitive loop. It ensures that every tool execution is followed by a fresh observation and reasoning step, improving the reliability of multi-step coding tasks.

### 2. Project Blueprint (Hyper-Context)
AskGem no longer starts "blind". The **ContextManager** now performs an automatic recursive scan of your working directory on startup, identifying the tech stack and project architecture before you even ask your first question.

### 3. Trust Management System
Implemented a robust **Directory Trust** layer. AskGem will now ask for permission before accessing or modifying files outside of your workspace or explicit "Trusted Folders", preventing accidental system-wide modifications.

### 4. Windows Cross-Drive Hardening
Specific security guards for Windows users: prevents unauthorized operations across different drive letters (e.g., C: to D:) unless explicitly trusted.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 to 3.14** (v0.10.0 adds support for Python 3.14).
- A **Google API Key** — free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.dev/).

### From source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julesklord/askgem.py
cd askgem.py
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Configuration

### API key (Standardized)

askgem loads your key from these sources, in order:

1. **Environment variable** — `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key askgem` (Preferred)
2. **System Keyring** — Secure storage via Windows Credential Manager or macOS Keychain (Recommended).
3. **Saved file** — `~/.askgem/settings.json` (Local fallback).

On first launch without a key, askgem prompts interactively and saves it securely in your system's keyring.

### Settings file

Stored at `~/.askgem/settings.json` (POSIX) or `%APPDATA%\askgem\settings.json` (Windows):

```json
{
    "model_name": "gemini-1.5-flash",
    "edit_mode": "manual"
}
```

### Configuration paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.askgem/settings.json` | Model name, edit mode, and user preferences |
| `~/.askgem/history/` | Auto-saved session JSON files |
| `~/.askgem/askgem.log` | Debug log — tool execution events and retry details |

---

## Usage

Launch the agent:

```bash
askgem
```

### Common Workflows

- **Context Analysis:** "Read my `pyproject.toml` and explain the dependencies."
- **Code Generation:** "Create a `src/utils.py` file with a function to calculate SHA256 hashes."
- **Refactoring:** "Refactor `authenticate()` in `src/auth.py` to use JWT instead of sessions."
- **Exploration:** "Find all TODO comments in the project and group them by file."

### Exiting

Type `exit`, `quit`, `q`, or press `Ctrl+C`.

## Safety model

**Always, regardless of mode (Sandboxed Environment):**

- **Trust Management Layer (v0.11.0):** askgem now implements a strict whitelist for file operations. By default, it can only touch the current workspace. Use `/trust` to authorize external paths.
- **Cross-Drive Protection:** On Windows, the agent is blocked from crossing drive letters (e.g., C: to G:) unless the target is explicitly trusted, preventing unintended system-wide access.
- **Risk Analysis Engine:** Powered by `core/security.py`, every command is categorized:
    - `SAFE`: Informative commands (ls, git status).
    - `NOTICE`: Standard operations.
    - `WARNING`: High-risk patterns (sudo, sensitive file access).
    - `DANGEROUS`: Critical risk (rm -rf, fork bombs, world-writable chmod).
- **Atomic Writing:** `edit_file` uses a temporary file + rename strategy to prevent corruption.
- **Automatic Backups:** Every file modification creates a `.bkp` backup at `<path>.bkp`.
- **Hard Timeouts:** Shell commands have a strict 60-second execution limit.

## Development & Simulation

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julesklord/askgem.py
cd askgem.py
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Reliable Testing Protocol

AskGem v0.10.0 introduces a **Simulation Layer**. You can record agent turns and play them back deterministically:

1. **Record:** Set `SIMULATION_MODE=record` to capture interactions.
2. **Playback:** Run `pytest tests/integration/test_full_agent_loop.py` to verify the logic against the recorded transcript without hitting the real API.

### Tests & Linting

```bash
pytest tests/                   # full reliable suite (39 tests)
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix    # auto-fix linting violations
```

## Internationalization

AskGem is **English-First** at the SDK/System level for maximum model reliability, but the entire user interface supports 8 languages:

| Code | Language | File |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English (Standard) | `en.json` |
| `es` | Español | `es.json` |
| `fr` | Français | `fr.json` |
| `pt` | Português | `pt.json` |
| `de` | Deutsch | `de.json` |
| `it` | Italiano | `it.json` |

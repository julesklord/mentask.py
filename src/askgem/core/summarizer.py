CRITICAL: Respond with TEXT ONLY. Do NOT call any tools.
Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:
1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation.
2. Identify user requests, technical decisions, file edits, and errors encountered.
3. Double-check for technical accuracy.

Your summary should include the following sections:
1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests.
2. Key Technical Concepts: List important technical concepts and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files examined, modified, or created. Include full code snippets where applicable.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them.
5. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results.
6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request.
8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take.

Example structure:
<analysis>
[Your thought process]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent: [Description]
2. Key Technical Concepts: [List]
3. Files and Code Sections: [List with snippets]

Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions.

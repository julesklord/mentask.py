## Current State Assessment

### What askgem v0.16.2 Can Do Today

| Capability | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multimodal Reasoning** | âœ… Shipped | Processes images, audio, and video via base64 encoding. |
| **On-Demand Knowledge** | âœ… Shipped | Optimized Knowledge Hub via `query_knowledge` tool. |
| **Autonomous Orchestration** | âœ… Shipped | Advanced Think -> Act -> Observe loop with 429 retry logic. |
| **TrustManager Security** | âœ… Shipped | Recursive directory validation and Path Traversal prevention. |
| **Web Research** | âœ… Shipped | Live internet search (Google/DDG) and content extraction. |
| **Full Validation** | âœ… Shipped | Broad unit/integration coverage across the core agent, tools, and CLI. |
| **Autonomous LSP** | âœ… Shipped | Real-time verification and self-correction via Ruff LSP. |
| **Professional TUI** | âœ… Shipped | Rich-based streaming CLI with Smuffle/Snuggles themes. |

## Milestone 1: Visual Identity and Stability (COMPLETED)

- [x] API Error Retry with Exponential Backoff
- [x] Dedicated `write_file` Tool
- [x] `/undo` Command (Restores `.bkp` snapshots)
- [x] Graceful Truncation of Oversized Context

## Milestone 2: Code Search Navigation (COMPLETED)

- [x] `grep_search` Tool (Pattern matching)
- [x] `glob_find` Tool (File discovery)
- [x] `diff_file` Tool (Unified diff previews)

## Milestone 3: Web Research Integration (COMPLETED)

- [x] `web_search` Tool (Google Search API integration)
- [x] `web_fetch` Tool (Markdown-friendly content extraction)

## Milestone 4: Architectural Sovereignty (COMPLETED)

- [x] Transition from Monolith to Specialized Managers
- [x] Pydantic integration for Agentturn schemas
- [x] Hierarchical Knowledge Hub (Standard/Global/Local)

---

## Milestone 5: Language Intelligence ("Bene Gesserit") (COMPLETED)

**Theme:** Transition from blind code editing to language-aware engineering.

### 5.1 LSP Client Bridge

- [x] Integration with Ruff via JSON-RPC.
- [x] Automated Lint-Fix Loop (Agent detects diagnostic and self-corrects).

### 5.2 Context Optimization

- [x] Semantic Truncation and proactive summarization.

## Milestone 6: Scalable Memory & Intelligence ("Shai-Hulud")

**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High
**Estimated Effort:** Q2 2026
**Theme:** Transition to vector-based memory, deep code understanding, and autonomous engineering.

### 6.1 Vector Memory Integration

- [ ] Implement local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for codebase indexing.
- [ ] Persistent project-level embeddings.

### 6.2 Multi-Agent Orchestration

- [ ] Sub-agent spawning for parallel task execution.

### 6.3 Deep Static Analysis & Refactoring

- [ ] Syntax-aware navigation (identifying classes, methods, and dependencies without full file reads).
- [ ] Intelligent Refactoring (safe renaming, method extraction, and dependency management).
- [ ] Detection of architectural pattern violations.


- [ ] Assisted conflict resolution and branch management.
- [ ] Automated pull request drafting and basic code reviews.


- [ ] Verification-first editing (generating tests before applying changes).
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated test-fix loops.


- [ ] Contextual fix suggestions for CLI/Command failures.
- [ ] Intelligent log probing for runtime error diagnosis.
- [ ] Intelligent Refactoring (safe renaming, method extraction, and dependency management).


- [ ] Assisted conflict resolution and branch management.

---

## Milestone 7: Professional Reliability ("Lisan al-Gaib")

**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
**Theme:** Self-testing, deep debugging, and predictive assistance.


- [ ] Verification-first editing (generating tests before applying changes).


- [ ] Contextual fix suggestions for CLI/Command failures.

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

| Item | Priority | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Translation Parity** | High | âœ… Solved in v0.13.2 (8 locales synchronized). |
| **Docs Consistency** | High | In progress; remove stale dashboard/TUI references and align docs with runtime behavior. |
| **CLI Contract Tests** | High | In progress; entrypoint tests aligned with current `--list` and default startup flow. |
| **Type Hinting** | Low | Partially complete; move toward stricter typing in orchestration and tool layers. |
